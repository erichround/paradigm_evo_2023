\title{Count the number of ways to place p stones in an m x n grid, under the
constraints that no row is empty; no column is empty; only one stone per
cell; cell (1,1) is filled; and cell (1,j) must also be filled, for some j >
1. This indicates the how many times a cell (1,j) is filled, among all the
solutions to the grid-filling constraints described for
`count_arrangements()`.}
\usage{
count_arrangements_1j(m, n, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{An integer. The number of grid rows.}

\item{n}{An integer. The number of grid columns.}

\item{p}{An integer. The number of stones}
}
\value{
An integer. The number of solutions.
